        "This notebook serves as an introduction to coding in Python for class COMPLIT 280X. We'll begin by presenting the outcome of today's session. After that, we'll delve into some fundamental concepts that will lead us to that final outcome.\n",

        "\n",
        "    To understand the basics syntax (\"grammar\" of the Python language)\n",
        "    To grasp fundamental concepts of IPython Notebooks.\n",
        "    To demonstrate that even a complex goal can be achieved step by step.\n",

        "By the end of this workshop, students should be able to comprehend the structure of a basic Python script and conduct rudimentary data analysis. They should also gain confidence in coding.\n",

        "Note: This course is tailored for literature majors. We simplify Python terminology and omit more advanced concepts to facilitate easier understanding. As a result, this workshop might differ significantly from typical introductory Python workshops. Students from STEM backgrounds might find it less comprehensive or detailed."
