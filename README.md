# data_storytelling

This is a draft syllabus for the course, "Data and Transmedia Storytelling," currently under development. The course structure revolves around four main modules—data, agent, world, and representation—which form the crucial elements of data-driven storytelling. Each week, we delve into a key concept under each category, while also developing digital tools to probe its potential for creative storytelling. Weekly materials are presented in a Jupyter notebook, incorporating tutorials and exercises. At times, these include step-by-step tutorials, designed to be easily followed, customized, and integrated into their own projects by students. At other times, they only introduce some existing solutions and projects. Upon concluding each module, students will also engage with an extended case drawn from specific contexts within literary and cultural history. Utilizing the tools and methodologies acquired during the course and beyond, students will be encouraged to devise "solutions" to these open-ended questions.
