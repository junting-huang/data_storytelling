# data_storytelling (under development)

How do W.E.B. du Bois’s data portraits communicate racial politics? How do Henry David Thoreau’s writings document climate change? Why are Samuel Beckett's characters often labeled autistic? And why does Hsia Yu use machines to translate found poetry? In our contemporary culture, where data not only informs but often dictates discourse, these questions underscore the profound intertwining of data with literary, historical, and sociopolitical narratives. In the past decades, historians use network analysis to discover previously unknown historical connections, literary scholars utilize sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and text mining to identify genres and other stylistic patterns, and media studies scholars use web scraping to develop digital archives. While data science has proven its analytical prowess, its potential for storytelling is often overlooked in many data-driven projects. This course aims to examine the theoretical foundation of data-driven storytelling and explore how data is incorporated into contemporary transmedia storytelling.

The course structure revolves around four main modules—language, agent, world, and representation—which form the crucial elements of storytelling. Each week, we delve into a key concept under each category, while also developing computational tools to probe its potential for creative storytelling. This is a beginner-friendly course tailored for individuals without any coding experience, serving as an introduction to Python programming. Weekly materials are presented in a Jupyter notebook, incorporating tutorials and exercises. At times, these include step-by-step tutorials, designed to be easily followed, customized, and integrated into their own projects by students. At other times, they only introduce some existing solutions and projects. Upon concluding each module, students will also engage with an extended case drawn from specific contexts within literary and cultural history. Utilizing the tools and methodologies acquired during the course and beyond, students will be encouraged to devise "solutions" to these open-ended questions.
