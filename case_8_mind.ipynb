        "A chatbot is a computer program designed to engage in natural language conversations with users, providing a conversational interface for interactions. These intelligent agents leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing technologies to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. Chatbots can be implemented in various applications, including websites, messaging platforms, and mobile apps, offering users a seamless and interactive way to obtain information, perform tasks, or receive assistance. They can range from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated models that continuously learn and adapt from user interactions. Chatbots find widespread use in customer support, virtual assistants, e-commerce, and information retrieval, streamlining communication processes and enhancing user experiences by providing instant and personalized responses in a conversational manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of deep learning, have led to the development of more sophisticated conversational agents. These advanced chatbots can understand context, sentiment, and user intent, providing a more natural and engaging conversation experience. Many businesses and organizations leverage chatbots for tasks such as customer support, appointment scheduling, product recommendations, and more. The rise of messaging platforms and the popularity of virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa further emphasize the increasing role of chatbots in our daily lives. As technology continues to evolve, chatbots are expected to play a crucial role in reshaping how we interact with information and services in the digital landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "In literature, chatbots are being explored as innovative tools for enhancing reader engagement, providing personalized recommendations, and creating interactive storytelling experiences. While traditional literature consumption is a solitary activity, chatbots bring a conversational dimension to the reading experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reader Engagement and Interaction: Chatbots can be designed to engage readers in conversations about the book's characters, themes, and plot points. This interactive approach can deepen readers' understanding and immersion in the story.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* Storytelling and Interactive Narratives: Some experimental chatbots are designed to deliver stories in a conversational format. Readers can interact with characters, make decisions that impact the plot, and experience a dynamic narrative tailored to their choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Literary Analysis and Discussions: Chatbots can facilitate discussions about literary works, providing insights into literary analysis, interpretations, and historical context. This can be particularly useful for students and book clubs seeking to deepen their understanding of literature.\n",
        "\n",
        "I am sure everyone is familiar with ChatGPT, which is the state-of-the-art chatbot in the present. In this lab, we are going to design a very simple chatbot."
